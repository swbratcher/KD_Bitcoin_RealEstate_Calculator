# KD Bitcoin Real Estate Calculator

A comprehensive, privacy-focused calculator for analyzing Bitcoin investment strategies alongside real estate refinancing decisions. This tool helps users model scenarios where Bitcoin holdings are used to optimize mortgage strategies.

## üéØ What This Tool Does

**For Property Owners**: Model how Bitcoin investments could affect your refinancing strategy, including cash-out refinancing and HELOC scenarios. Calculate optimal payoff timing and risk assessment.

**For Bitcoin Holders**: Analyze how real estate leverage can be combined with Bitcoin appreciation to build wealth while managing debt payoff timing.

**Core Analysis**:
- Month-by-month cash flow projections over 20-30 years
- Bitcoin performance modeling with multiple scenarios (Bullish, Realistic, Bearish)
- Loan payoff optimization triggers (2x debt value, retained BTC amount, etc.)
- Risk assessment including market drawdown scenarios
- Property appreciation alongside Bitcoin growth

## üîí Privacy & Security First

- **100% Client-Side**: All calculations run in your browser
- **No Data Collection**: Your financial information never leaves your device
- **No Analytics**: No tracking, cookies, or data transmission
- **Open Source**: Full transparency with MIT license
- **Future-Proof**: Works offline, includes Bitcoin price fallback system

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Users

1. **Visit the Calculator**: Deploy to any static hosting or run locally
2. **Enter Property Details**: Current value, mortgage balance, monthly payment
3. **Choose Loan Strategy**: Cash-out refinance or HELOC
4. **Set Bitcoin Parameters**: Investment amount and growth scenario
5. **Analyze Results**: View projections, charts, and risk assessments

### Current Bitcoin Price

The tool automatically fetches live Bitcoin prices from CoinGecko API. If the API is unavailable, it gracefully falls back to a manual input field pre-populated with $100,000 that you can adjust.
