# Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy documentation files that are preserved for reference but should not be used for active development.

## Contents

- `prd-real-property-calculator.md` - Original PRD (superseded by revised version)
- `tasks-prd-real-property-calculator.md` - Original task list (superseded by revised version)

## Current Active Documentation

**For AI Models**: Do NOT use files in this archive directory. Use the current documentation:

- **Primary PRD**: `../prd-real-property-calculator-revised.md`
- **Primary Tasks**: `../tasks-prd-real-property-calculator-revised.md`
- **Architecture**: `../architecture-overview.md`
- **Functions**: `../function-reference.md`
- **Data Flow**: `../data-flow-map.md`

## Purpose

These files are archived to:
1. Preserve project history
2. Allow comparison of original vs evolved scope
3. Provide local reference for development team
4. Prevent confusion with current active documentation

**Note**: The current implementation has evolved significantly beyond the original MVP scope documented in these archived files.
